# Service Discovery

Service discovery is an important aspect of a microservices architecture.  A
service will register with a central service repository.  The registration
information usually consists of a service name and how to access the service via
the network (a URL).  When another service wishes to use the functionality
provided by a service, the other service will look up the access information
from the central service repository.  This 'on the fly' service registry and lookup
allows for the microservice architecture to be agile and evolve overtime.

# Eureka

Eureka is a service repository created by Netflix.  Netflix released the code
as an open source project.  Spring Boot provides an easy to use API for
Eureka

The code found in this repository is an Eureka server.  You should be able to
easily build and deploy an Eureka server.

## Configuring
The properties for the Eureka server are found in

    src/main/resources/application.yml

The values are setup to be read from the environment (Config factor).  On Linux, you can configure
the Eureka server by exporting the properties and values to the environment.  For example, here is how you would change the port

    export PORT=9034

This will set the value for "server.port" to 9034.


## Securing
Spring security is defined as a dependency in the build.gradle file.  This will enable basic authentication for the web services so we are protected when deploying to the cloud.

In the
    src/main/resources/application.yml

You will see properties for the basic authentication used by Spring security.

    security:
      user:
        name: ${EUREKA_USER_NAME}
        password: ${EUREKA_PASSWORD}

Export the value for EUREKA_USER_NAME and EUREKA_PASSWORD to the environment.  Ensure your password is strong.

Avoid characters that are special to URLS (@, :, /, %, ?).  The user name and password will be used to build URLs to access the services.

## Building
The Eureka server can be built with the following command

    ./gradlew build


## Running Locally
The Eureka server can be started with the following command.

    java -jar ./build/libs/eureka-server-0.1.0.jar

By default, the Eureka server listens on port 8761.  You can access the server
via the following URL

http://localhost:8761

You will be prompted for the user name and password.
